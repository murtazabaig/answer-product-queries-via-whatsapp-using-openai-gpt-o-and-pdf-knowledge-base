  "description": "WHATSAPP AI SALES AGENT USING PDF VECTOR STOREThis workflow turns your WhatsApp number into an intelligent AI-powered SalesAgent that answers product queries using real data extracted from a PDFbrochure. It loads a product brochure via HTTP Request, converts it intoembeddings using OpenAI, stores them in an in-memory vector store and allows theAI Agent to provide factual answers to users via WhatsApp. Non-text messages arefiltered and only text queries are processed. This makes the workflow ideal forbuilding a lightweight chatbot that understands your product documentationdeeply.QUICK START: 5-STEP FAST IMPLEMENTATION 1. Insert your WhatsApp credentials in the WhatsApp Trigger and WhatsApp Send nodes. 2. Add your OpenAI API Key to all OpenAI-powered nodes. 3. Replace the PDF URL in the HTTP Request node with your own brochure. 4. Run the Manual Trigger once to build the vector store. 5. Activate the workflow and start chatting from WhatsApp.WHAT IT DOESThis workflow converts a product brochure (PDF) into a searchable knowledgebaseusing LangChain vector embeddings. Incoming WhatsApp messages are processed andif the message is text, the AI Sales Agent uses OpenAI + the vector store toproduce accurate, brochure-based answers.The AI responds naturally to customer queries, supports conversation memoryacross the session and retrieves information directly from the brochure whenneeded. Non-text messages are filtered out to maintain clean conversationalflow.The workflow is fully modular: you can replace the PDF, modify AI prompts, pluginto CRM systems or extend it into a broader sales automation pipeline.WHO’S IT FORThis workflow is ideal for: * Businesses wanting a WhatsApp-based AI customer assistant. * Sales teams needing automated product query handling. * Companies with large product catalog PDFs. * Marketers wanting a zero-code product brochure chatbot. * Technical teams experimenting with LangChain + OpenAI inside n8n.REQUIREMENTS TO USE THIS WORKFLOWTo run this workflow successfully, you need: * An n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted). * A WhatsApp Business API connection. * An OpenAI API key. * A publicly accessible PDF brochure URL. * Basic familiarity with n8n node configuration.Optional: * A custom vector store backend (Qdrant, Pinecone) – the template uses in-memory storage.HOW IT WORKS & HOW TO SET UP1. IMPORT THE WORKFLOW JSONUpload the workflow JSON provided.2. CONFIGURE WHATSAPP TRIGGER * Open WhatsApp Trigger * Add your WhatsApp credentials * Set the webhook correctly to match your n8n endpoint3. CONFIGURE WHATSAPP RESPONSE NODESThe workflow uses two WhatsApp send nodes: * Reply To User → Sends AI response * Reply To User1 → Sends “unsupported message” replyAdd your WhatsApp credentials to both.4. REPLACE THE PDF BROCHUREIn get Product Brochure (HTTP Request): * Update the url parameter with your own PDF5. RUN THE PDF → VECTOR STORE SETUP (ONE-TIME ONLY)Use the Manual Trigger (\"When clicking ‘Test workflow’\") to: * Download the PDF * Extract text * Split into chunks * Generate embeddings * Store them in Product Catalogue vector store> You must run this once after importing the workflow.6. SET OPENAI CREDENTIALSAdd your OpenAI API Key to the following nodes: * OpenAI Chat Model * OpenAI Chat Model1 * Embeddings OpenAI * Embeddings OpenAI17.

MULTI-LANGUAGE SUPPORTAdd OpenAI translation nodes before agent input.2. CRM INTEGRATIONSend user queries and chat logs into: * HubSpot * Salesforce * Zoho CRM3. PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION ENGINEUse embeddings similarity to suggest products.4. ORDER PLACEMENT WORKFLOWConnect to Stripe or Shopify APIs.5. ANALYTICS DASHBOARDLog chats into Airtable / Postgres for analysis.USE CASE EXAMPLESHere are some practical uses: 1. Product Inquiry Chatbot Customers ask about specs, pricing, or compatibility. 2.
